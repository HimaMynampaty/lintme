description: |
  This rule validates all Markdown links for correctness and availability. Specifically, it:
    - Checks Markdown links for proper formatting, identifying malformed or empty links, and optionally auto-fixes them.
    - Ensures URLs use allowed schemes (e.g., "https") as specified.
    - Validates internal links against actual headings within the document.
    - Checks external links by verifying their reachability and allowed HTTP response codes.

error: |
  Possible failure scenarios include:
    - Malformed links (e.g., missing brackets or parentheses, empty links).
    - URLs using disallowed schemes (e.g., "http" instead of "https").
    - Internal links pointing to non-existent headings within the document.
    - External links returning unexpected HTTP status codes, or failing due to request errors or timeouts.
