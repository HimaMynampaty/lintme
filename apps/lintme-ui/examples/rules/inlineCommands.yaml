  This rule validates inline commands embedded within Markdown content. Specifically, it:
    - Extracts and optionally executes inline commands, reporting execution errors or timeouts.
    - Ensures commands conform to safe execution practices (sandboxed if enabled).
    - Optionally uses an AI model to validate commands and provide correction suggestions.
    - Checks commands for formatting issues, such as unnecessary spaces or empty command blocks.

error: |
  Possible failure scenarios include:
    - Inline commands failing execution due to runtime errors, invalid commands, or timeouts.
    - Command execution blocked due to sandboxed safe-mode restrictions.
    - Invalid or unsafe commands identified by the AI validation process.
    - Commands containing formatting issues like leading/trailing whitespace or empty commands.
    - Issues communicating with the AI backend or command validation service.
