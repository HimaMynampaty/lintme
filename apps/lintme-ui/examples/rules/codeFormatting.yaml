  This rule verifies Markdown code block correctness, enforcing proper syntax and formatting standards. Specifically, it:
    - Ensures all fenced code blocks specify an allowed programming language.
    - Validates that only approved code block formats ("fenced" and/or "indented") are used.
    - Detects malformed code fences (incorrect backtick usage or incomplete fences).
    - Checks indentation consistency within code blocks (identifies irregular spacing, inconsistent indentation, and mixing tabs with spaces).
    - Provides optional auto-fixing for detected formatting issues, such as malformed fences.

error: |
  Possible failure scenarios include:
    - Missing or invalid language tags in fenced code blocks.
    - Usage of disallowed code block formats ("fenced" or "indented") per defined rules.
    - Malformed code fences (e.g., incorrect number of backticks).
    - Indentation issues within code blocks, including inconsistent spacing or mixing tabs with spaces.
    - Failures in automatic fixing (if enabled), potentially due to complex formatting issues.
