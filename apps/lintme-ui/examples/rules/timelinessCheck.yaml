  This rule validates that Markdown documentation includes timely and accurate information on tool support status and dependency versions. Specifically, it:
    - Checks if the README explicitly mentions the end-of-support (EOL) information.
    - Uses AI-based validation to extract prerequisite tools and their specified versions from the README, comparing them with the latest available versions to identify outdated or inaccurate version details.

error: |
  Possible failure scenarios include:
    - Missing or unclear end-of-support (EOL) information in the README.
    - Dependencies or prerequisite tools listed in the README are outdated or incorrect when compared to their latest available versions.
    - Issues with AI-based dependency validation, such as communication failures or invalid responses from the AI model.
