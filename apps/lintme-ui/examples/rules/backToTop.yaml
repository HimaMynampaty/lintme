description: |
  This rule checks for a "Back to Top" navigation link to improve readability in longer documents.  
  It looks for a link with configured text (e.g., "Back to Top", "Top", "Return") that points to the top heading.  
  If missing and `auto_fix: true`, a link is inserted after each section or at the bottom, based on `mode`.

error: |
  Possible issues:
    - Missing "Back to Top" link in the document.
    - No headings detected to generate a valid anchor.
    - Auto-fix failure (e.g., invalid config, write errors).
    - Incorrect or unrecognized `mode` value.
