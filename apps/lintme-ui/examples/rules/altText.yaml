  This rule verifies that all images in the markdown file have appropriate alternative (alt) text.
  It parses the markdown AST, identifies all images, and checks if their alt text is neither empty nor whitespace-only.
  Optionally, it can generate AI-based suggestions for missing alt text.

error: |
  Possible failure scenarios:
    - Image has no alt text provided.
    - Alt text contains only whitespace or is invalid.
    - Issues in generating AI-based alt text suggestions (if enabled), such as communication errors with the AI backend or invalid responses.
