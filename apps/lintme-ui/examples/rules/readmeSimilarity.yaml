description: |
  This rule ensures that the current README content remains consistent with one or more previous versions.
  It compares the current README against the historical versions provided via `github_urls` and reports
  both whole-document and per-section similarity scores.

  The `similarity_method` defines how this comparison is performed. Available options:

    - cosine: Compares term frequency vectors using classic TF-IDF + cosine similarity.
    - embedding_cosine: Uses sentence embeddings to measure meaning-level similarity via cosine distance.
    - sectional_embedding: Compares each section independently using embeddings and aggregates their scores.
    - euclidean: Measures absolute distance between document embeddings (sensitive to magnitude).
    - damerau_levenshtein: Calculates raw character-level edit distance (insertions, deletions, substitutions, swaps).

  If no method is specified, the linter defaults to `embedding_cosine`.

  Use this rule to detect major changes, inconsistencies, or regressions in README documentation across versions.

error: |
  Possible failure scenarios include:
    - README has drifted significantly from one or more historical versions.
    - Required sections are missing, renamed, or heavily modified.
    - The similarity score between versions falls below an acceptable threshold.
    - Section-level similarity is low, even if the overall score is high.
