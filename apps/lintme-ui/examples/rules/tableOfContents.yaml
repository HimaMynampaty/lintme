rules:
  table_of_contents:
    required: true
    auto_fix: true

description: |
  This rule ensures the Markdown file includes a "## Table of Contents" followed by a list linking to level 2â€“4 headings.  
  If missing, it reports a warning (or specified level) at the first heading or line 4, whichever is lower.  
  When `auto_fix: true`, a TOC is generated and inserted after the first heading.

error: |
  Possible issues:
    - Missing or malformed TOC (e.g., no list after the heading).
    - Auto-fix errors (e.g., AST parse failure, insertion issues).
    - Misconfigured rule (e.g., missing `level` or invalid config).
