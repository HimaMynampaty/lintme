description: |
  This rule detects redundant repetition in the Markdown, including overused words/phrases, repeated sentences, and consecutive duplicates (e.g., "very very").  
  It counts total usage (`count: true`), flags frequency by type (`count_occurances`), and uses both inline and file-based word lists.  
  Violations are reported by paragraph, page, heading, or code block, with configurable thresholds.

error: |
  Possible issues:
    - Target word/phrase exceeds allowed frequency in a section or entire document.
    - Consecutive word repetition found (e.g., "just just").
    - Identical sentence appears in multiple locations.
    - Invalid word list path or malformed `count_occurances` config.
