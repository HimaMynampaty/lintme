  This rule scans Markdown content for potential sensitive information or secrets. Specifically, it:
    - Detects sensitive credentials such as API keys, tokens, private keys, and passwords based on predefined regex patterns.
    - Utilizes an AI-based validation step to identify sensitive data that may not match known patterns but still poses security risks.

error: |
  Possible failure scenarios include:
    - Detection of sensitive data matching known secret patterns (e.g., AWS keys, Stripe keys, GitHub tokens, SSH private keys, JWT tokens).
    - Sensitive information identified through AI validation that does not match predefined patterns, including API keys, passwords, tokens, or other confidential details.
    - Issues with AI backend validation, such as communication errors or invalid responses.
