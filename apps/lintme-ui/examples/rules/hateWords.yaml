  This rule detects potentially harmful, biased, or profane language using both Retext plugins and user-defined terms.  
  It highlights flagged terms and suggests alternatives where possible.  
  When `auto_fix: true`, flagged words are automatically replaced using provided suggestions or Retext recommendations.

  Possible issues:

    - Profanity or insensitive phrasing flagged by Retext.
    - Auto-fix errors (e.g., failed replacement, missing suggestions).
    - Invalid configuration (e.g., missing `hate_words` or `suggestions` mapping).
